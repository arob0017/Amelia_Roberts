# Responsive_Portfolio

This is my responsive portfolio. This page showcases my skills as web-developer as well as my musical and artistic career. 

I have made a 3-page website using 3 html files - a home, portfolio and contact - and by using the Bootstrap CSS Framework as well as my own, I have created a mobile responsive portfolio. I have used Semantic HTML throughout when necessary and have a consistent 'navbar' at the top of each page consisting of a Home, Portfolio and Contact link.

My home page consists of a jumbotron Boostrap container which includes some photos of myself and my biography. The images adjust size and text reorganises itself when the width of the browser is modified. This was done by using Bootstrap's grid-system.

My Portfolio page consists of multiple responsive 'boxes' containing pictures of my Performance, Teaching, Photography and Webdevelopment that are layed out in an aesthetically pleasing fashion. Having a grid-system within a grid-system has enabled me to do this. I have also used another 'navbar' in this page in the main content to navigate to each of my portfolio topics.

In my Contact page, I have used a responsive Bootstrap 'form' so that viewers can send me a message. 

At the bottom of each of my pages I have a sticky footer that contains and links to my relevant Social-Media sites.
