                            Roberts in 2019 performed as a member of the Monash Jazz Orchestra (MoJO) as their
                            pianist playing several times at venues such as ‘The Fyrefly’ in StKilda
                            and the on-campus jazz club, ’Script’.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Following this, Roberts was one of 15 selected to travel to Prato, Italy to perform
                            Italian jazz with an ensemble. She also recorded an album with this
                            ensemble at their local recording studio for Monash University’s database.

                            Amelia has been teaching piano to students of all ages for the past three years. Mainly
                            teaching primary school students,
                            Roberts has been able to develop a lesson structure for individual lessons as well as
                            group lessons. Combining both classical and jazz into her class,
                            opens the imaginative and creative minds of her students. Not only does the student
                            learn how to play, but also learns to create their own musical sound.

                            2020 has big plans for Amelia Roberts. Currently undertaking an online coding course,
                            Amelia prepares to share her music knowledge through her own online
                            teaching site in which she will develop herself. It is clear that COVID-19 is not
                            stopping Amelia from achieving her goals.
